# Quantum Chemistry

Project developed during the class of Quantum Computation of the masters in Physics Engineering of University of Minho.

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is explored to determine the minimum state energy of three molecules: $H_2$, NaH and $BeH_2$.  For this, two different ansatzes were explored: UCCSD with a Hartree Fock initialisation and the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2, with the accompanying optimisers SPSA and SLSQP respectively. This method proved possible the computation of the minimum state energy of molecules, obtaining only a $4.38\%$ error, in comparison to classical methods, in real hardware.
